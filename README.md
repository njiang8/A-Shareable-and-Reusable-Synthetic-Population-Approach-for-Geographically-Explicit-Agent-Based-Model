# A-Shareable-and-Reusable-Synthetic-Population-Approach-for-Geographically-Explicit-Agent-Based-Model
There are four parts in this project: 1) Synthetic Population ; 2) Traffic Dynamic Model; 3) Disaster Reponse Model; 4) Disease Dynamic Model.

## Part One
[Shrable and Resuable Synthetic Population](https://github.com/njiang8/Create_Synthetic_Population). Method that creates Sharable and Reusable Synthetic Population

## Part Two
[Traffic Dynamic Model](https://github.com/njiang8/Traffic_Model_NYC). Agent-Base Model: Simulation of Traffic Dynamic in High-Desity Urban Area (NYC)
